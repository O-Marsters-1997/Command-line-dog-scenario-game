Hello and welcome to my dog scenario game. It is the first thing I have made completely from scratch in both Python and in programming more generally.(1) 

The objective is to ensure that your dog remains healthy for a week. Your dog starts off with various core statistics. These are as follows:
sleepiness: 50
hunger: 50
playfulness: 50 
comfort: 50 
hydration: 50

For every question that you asnwer, these statistics will change depending on the answers you provide.
To ensure that your dog reamins healthy throughout the week, each of your dog's statistics must be below 85 and avove 15.

You will be asked 5 questions, one for each day that you are required to look after your dog. If you mange to answer all 5 questions, whilst maintaing your dog's statistics within the healthy range, then you will have completed your objective. 

Notes
1)  This is a simple terminal-based text based scenario     game. I created it so     that I could put my           learning of for and while loops,    if stamtement       and functions into practice.
